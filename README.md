# Car Finder 🚘
Car Finder is a frontend-only React.js web application designed to help users find cars based on specific criteria. This app simulates a fully-functional experience using dummy JSON data to filter, browse, and wishlist vehicles. It’s a demonstration of a responsive, feature-rich UI without the need for a backend.
Note: The Contact page is currently non-functional, as no backend integration was required for this project.

## 📌 Features
- 🔍 Filter cars by: Brand, Price Range, Fuel Type, Seating Capacity
- ❤️ Add/Remove cars from Wishlist (persisted using localStorage)
- 🧠 Smart Filtering – filters update UI instantly with no page reload
- 🔄 Real-time UI Updates using React state
- 📄 Pagination – shows 9 cars per page
- 💻 Responsive Design – works on all screen sizes
- 🚫 Graceful fallback for empty search results
- 🎨 Sleek and modern UI using TailwindCSS

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- React.js – UI and component logic
